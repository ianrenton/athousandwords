				<p>"a thousand words" is a fiction-writing community developed from the saying that "A picture paints a thousand words".</p>
				<p><br/>At regular intervals, a picture is chosen and displayed on the front page of the site.  These pictures are chosen from those submitted by the site's users.  You, as a user, are hopefully inspired by the picture to write a short story of approximately a thousand words based on it or whatever feelings it evokes in you.</p>
				<p><br/>Stories are then rated by awarding stars, and commented on by the rest of the community.  You can request critique of your work, or simply compete to be the user with the most stars to their name!</p>
				<p><br/>"a thousand words" was created by <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/ericthegirl/">Eric</a> and <a href="http://www.onlydreaming.net/about-me">Ian Renton</a> &#8212; we hope you enjoy it!</p>
